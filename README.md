# Translation Tool XP

A RPG Maker XP project that can extract texts from the .rxdata files to some .txt files and import them back.

My TODO list:
- add comments everywhere !
- implement a multilanguage interface & methods

My whishlist:
- migrate the project to an open interpreter

## How-To

1. Put the folder 'translation-tool-xp' in the root folder of your RPG Maker XP project.
2. Launch the 'Game.exe' and export the desired files.
3. Modify the texts. (You can shorten or make the texts longer, it will work fine)
4. Import the modifed texts back in the '.rxdata' and the texts are replaced !
