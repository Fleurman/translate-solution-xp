# Translation Tool XP
This tool aim to provide a translating solution for RPG Maker XP games.
TTXP can extract texts from the .rxdata files into .txt files and import them back.

My TODO list:
- add comments everywhere !
- implement a multilanguage interface & methods

## How-To

1. Put the folder 'translation-tool-xp' in the root folder of your RPG Maker XP project.
2. Launch the 'TTXP.exe' and export the desired files.
3. Modify the texts. (You can shorten or make the texts longer, it will work fine)
4. Import the modifed texts back in the '.rxdata' and the texts are replaced !
